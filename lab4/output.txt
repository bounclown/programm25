Distinct, but distant — clear, but oh, how cold!
A night-beam Sorrow watcheth to behold,
Which shines, but warms not with its powerless rays;
So gleams the past, the light of other days,
qwerrty

How like art thou to joy remember’d well!
That show’st the darkness thou canst not dispel,
Whose tearful beam glows tremulously far,
Sun of the sleepless! Melancholy star!
